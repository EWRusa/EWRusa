Hi my name is Emmett and I am a computer science student seeking an internship or employment.
I have work experience in troubleshooting and customer service that has helped me develop strong communication skills.
Iâ€™m eager to explore the field of computer science and learn more beyond my proficiency in Java and my basic understanding of Python, C, and C++.
I look forward to working with you and bringing my passion and work ethic to the table!
