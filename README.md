About Me
======
Hi! My name is Emmett, currently I am a Colorado State University Senior, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in AI/Machine Learning.

I began working in software engineering since my first internship with Ford Motor Company in May 2022 under their Model e branch and I have been expanding my knowledge and experiences since then, learning new technologies and methodologies whenever I can.

I am very eager to learn and explore any and everything I can as a Computer Scientist and person as I love to learn and grow my skill sets, alongside acquiring new ones everyday.

I also have interests in bouldering, antique vehicle restoration, math, and I love to play music with my friends!
